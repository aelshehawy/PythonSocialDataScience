# Python for Social Data Science
Python for Social Data Science (Oxford 2023)

Social Data Science with Python
Course provider: Ashrakat Elshehawy
 
DPIR (open to other Oxford department's as well) postgraduate students are encouraged to attend a 6-week course to learn the programming language Python in Hillary Term 2023. Python programming knowledge is becoming increasingly essential for Social Scientists working on applications for computational social science research, such as machine learning and computational text analysis. 

The structure of the course will be a 2-hour Python class and 1-hour Python clinic for code de-bugging purposes and project presentations. This will take place on Tuesdays from 4pm-7pm.

Important note: Attendance of this course is obligatory if you want to attend the Computational Text Analysis Class offered in Trinity 2023 (You can get an exemption if you show previous attendance of a Python class through a transcript or similar document). These two classes can be viewed as a sequence.
